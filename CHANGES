-----------------------------------

danielprice (18):

      version number bumped
      xw driver returns key bindings for right/middle clicks and scroll events
      circle cursor uses filled, partially transparent circle similar to rectangle selection

      added giza_rectangle_rounded routine for plotting rectangles with rounded corners
      BUG FIX with giza_function_x/y/t interfaces with gfortran v4.7; also giza_plot_line now giza_line in Fortran interface

-----------------------------------

danielprice (34):
      bug fix in default viewport causing labels with giza_label to be clipped
      giza-annotate code shortened (unnecessary extra lines removed)
      bug fix with chopped labels in giza_label
      updated list of fortran params automatically
      changed order of long/short dashes; line styles in libpgplot now always match pgplot
      test added for memory leaks in X11
      bug fix with log labelling of 1 and 10
      valgrind bug fix with init_device_list using uninitialised string
      basic test of multiple open/close calls added
      markerHeight declared static

      [PATCH contributed by Daniel Kelson] viewport and window now handle xmin>xmax and ymin>ymax correctly
      added const to all array input variables; consistent with cpgplot interface
      public header files now live in the include directory rather than being copied around

-----------------------------------
Changes in 0.7.1 compared to 0.7.0
-----------------------------------

danielprice (31):
      updated include paths
      better flush of xevents
      silenced spurious warnings in giza-points and giza-polygon
      uses libtool instead of c compiler to build shared library
      more warnings silenced
      handles failure to call close_device; also bug fix with _giza_lowercase
      handles failure to call close_device; also bug fix with _giza_lowercase
      bug fix with whitespace in device names
      whitespace removed from strings in when passed through giza-fortran interface
      better linewidth conversion between pgplot and giza in libpgplot
      implemented option to give exact pgplot colour table
      better placement of text above viewport in giza-annotate
      spurious whitespace at end of lines removed (script)
      bug fix with len_trim in f2c string conversion
      added giza_colour_palette routines; libpgplot uses PGPLOT colour palette by default
      shared lib extension determined automatically
      build more portable on os/x vs linux
      still working on dylib vs .so; works on both now
      minor changes to Makefile structure
      id decreased again when device close (fixes spurious warnings)
      all drivers call get_filename_for_device; avoids trim/case issues
      added $PREFIX/include to include line
      checks gfortran version number and gives error if gfortran is too old to compile fortran interface
      gfortran version checks work with old gfortran (v4.1.2) and give error
      standard viewport (as used by giza_environment) now leaves boundary of 4 character heights on each size rather than a fixed fraction
      added comments to postscript header
      set_viewport_inches uses Dev.width not Dev.widthCM (safer)
      paper size queries use Dev.width not Dev.widthCM (safer)
      rejigged the way the paper size is set; can now be set in different units; set_paper_size calls redone; Dev.widthCM and Dev.heightCM removed; less confusing all round
      header included for internal routine
      bumped version number
