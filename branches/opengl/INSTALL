Not much work has been put into portability yet, so good luck!

You will need a c compiler, cairo and X11 development packages. If they are 
ready to go running "make SYSTEM=linux" should build giza using gcc,
and "make install SYSTEM=linux" should install on a linux system.

If you need to change library paths for cairo of Xlib have a look
at build/Makefile.
